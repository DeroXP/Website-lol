                    <h3>VeteranMode-Terraria</h3>
                    <p>The overarching theme of Veteran Mode centers around the extreme challenges players face in the environment. Enemies and bosses (excluding friendly NPCs) will exhibit drastic enhancements in difficulty, with increased life regeneration, health, damage, defense, and speed. To counterbalance this difficulty, we're in the process of creating items and assets to aid players, such as boss armors and summoners. Immunity frames have been completely removed for an even more challenging experience. Only one boss will be added to this Mod until the next release, and we will provide the source code on GitHub for those interested in exploring and creating mods and addons for Veteran Mode. If you decide to use our code, please credit the developers by linking to this repository in your mod/addon description, even if you've made modifications.</p>

                    <h3>Nurser-Terraria</h3>
                    <p>Nurser was made just because. And to allow player to use a nurse NPC type of logic anywhere but with anti-cheating configs, to keep the game more fair. Basically Nurser heals you up all the way back to full health and then once you've healed nurse taxes you for the amount of health healed, which can be configurable via Mod Settings. The intended use for Nurser Dev-Testing, Project referencing, and General Playing. Nurser is open-source to the public and will be updated every once in a while, most updates are for bug fixes, but if Nurser has updated in a while is because their will be a big one that won't be updated until it is fully working and finished. This may not mean there won't be any bugs, dev team has two people in it one a programmar one a manager. zThis recent version should work for Tmodloader v2024.4.2.0 and a lil buggy for v2024.3.2.5 previews, because i can't update it for v2024.3.2.5 for some reason.</p>
